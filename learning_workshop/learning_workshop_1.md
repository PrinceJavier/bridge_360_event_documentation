## Preworkshop Publicity

The event was publicized through Bridge 360's Facebook page and through personal LinkedIn posts. The first Facebook post reached over 1,000 users. The second Facebook post, posted at around 6PM of the day before reached 200 users.

The conversion rate, or the number of users reached by the posters and who registered was 0.5%. **For the next event, if we want to target 25 participants, we need to reach 5000 participants on Facebook.**

An Eventbrite page was made for the event. The tickets were set to Free to avoid the need to pay via PayPal. However, it was mentioned in the ticket description that the regular ticket is Php 750 and student rate is Php 500. This  description doesn't show up by default.

Reminders were emailed through Eventbrite three days before the event and one day before the event. The rate was mentioned in the email. 

One user emailed us telling us that he thought the event was free, because it was free in Eventbrite. We apologized for the confusion and clarified that we only did that to make the experience hassle free but they could pay on the day itself. He replied that he's no longer coming.

Because of this, we changed the ticket name to include the event price. **For the next event, we recommend to include the ticket price in the ticket name**

## Participants
There were a total of four "organic" participants. One of the participants thought that the event was free. But when we said it was paid, he replied that it was fine. One participant was Kai Javier who was invited by Prince Javier. Another invited guest was Lorenzo Sta Maria, who was a CHED consultant who stayed from 1 to 2pm.

## Event Logistics
Recruitday sponsored the venue on the 5th floor of Paseo Center, Makati City. The venue was a board room with a long table in the middle surrounded by around 10 chairs. Television screens were used to project the slides while a digital blackboard was provided for writing during the talk. Lunch and drinks (coffee, water, or milktea) were sponsored by Recruitday.

The venue was changed from 4th floor to 5th floor on the day before the event. We emailed participants about this the day before. But three participants weren't able to read them so went to the 4th floor first.

## Notable Improvements in Participant Learning
In terms of working memory, the participants initially could remember an average of 7.2 items in one minute, which improved to 10.4 items after using Memory Palace Technique. **This is a whopping 44% improvement!**

All participants were able to integrate all learnings about Learning Hacks into a single mind map which they were able to explain. **This proves that they learned the material after the workshop.**

## Evaluation by Participants
At the end of the workshops, we asked participants to evaluate the workshop. 

### Learning Hacks for Industry 4.0

The comments are:
* Great job!
* Everything is awesome. Material, instruction and teaching are all clear. :)
* Set proper timing for exercises to get rid of dull moments. Overall, it’s excellent and easily understandable
* You can provide a handout that outlines the workshop so that the participants can just use it to take notes on.

### Design Thinking 101

The comments are:
* Great job!
* The original presenter wasn’t present and so this might have affected the overall experience of the workshop. The ideas are good but the presentation can be improved. Consider the people coming from different fields. Consider topic appreciation for everyone. The workshop topics are all useful, though. I enjoyed them overall.
* Make more time for design thinking and discuss the actuall steps so participants can go through it

### Overall Workshop
The participants found out about the event through word of mouth, Facebook, and EventBrite.

Other comments are:
* Very interesting hope there will be more events like this
* Do workshops near QC! Or in other areas as well that are more accessible to students
* Good idea to start this!

## Preworkshop Publicity

## Evaluation Results
At the end of the workshops, we asked participants to evaluate the workshop. 

### Learning Hacks for Industry 4.0

The comments are:
* Great job!
* Everything is awesome. Material, instruction and teaching are all clear. :)
* Set proper timing for exercises to get rid of dull moments. Overall, it’s excellent and easily understandable
* You can provide a handout that outlines the workshop so that the participants can just use it to take notes on.

### Design Thinking 101

The comments are:
* Great job!
* The original presenter wasn’t present and so this might have affected the overall experience of the workshop. The ideas are good but the presentation can be improved. Consider the people coming from different fields. Consider topic appreciation for everyone. The workshop topics are all useful, though. I enjoyed them overall.
* Make more time for design thinking and discuss the actuall steps so participants can go through it

### Overall Workshop
The participants found out about the event through word of mouth, Facebook, and EventBrite.

Other comments are:
* Very interesting hope there will be more events like this
* Do workshops near QC! Or in other areas as well that are more accessible to students
* Good idea to start this!

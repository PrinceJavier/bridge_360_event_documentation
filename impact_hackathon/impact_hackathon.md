# Impact Hackathon
Araneta Coliseum
October 30 - 31, 2019
<br>Rage Gonzales, Prince Javier, Jad Davalos

## Background
Impact Hub organized a hackathon called Impact Hackathon

## CleanApp
Takeaway: 
* QR code that the eco aid will scan from the generator.

## Trash Cash
Takeaways: 
* ML to calculate value of a trash, schedule for pickup, and earn. QR code for payment.
* Need to set up a network of collection points
* How will the pricing be calculated?

## What went right?
- got introduced to Jhaze Asuncion of UPSCALE (jhaze@enterprise.upd.edu.ph)
- integrated AI feature — trash classification into the app
- we got to meet people: Paul Harris; Joseph; Ma’am Arne; Ma’am Grace (fintech)
- dodged the bullet with Mark Vernon
- exposure
- finished an entire hackathon together (Jani, Prince, and Rage)
-----> 
- Gelato libre ni rage hehe
- Starbucks, Potato Corner, Seattle’s Best, Taco Bell
- We got to learn other people’s ideas: TrashCash; CleanApp
——> Let’s integrate QR code scanner
——> Pricing the trash based on photo (?)
- Rage was able to finish the YSEALI proposal despite participating in the hackathon
- Parrot GIF
- naitawid ang demo kahit na may bugs nung una and hindi updated yung code

## What went wrong?
- we didn’t clarify the mechanics enough; organizer (daniel) pushed that we stay even though we thought 
- misalignment of expectations
- not prepared to overnight
- venue (SMART ARANETA COLISEUM) not amenable for hackathon
- no veg food (magastos tuloy lalo)
- food itself is shit (junk food lahat and dry)
- no free coffee!
- too noisy! too distracting—too much announcements
- no proper space to sleep
- too cold
- too much light — mas maliwanag pa sa kinabukasan namin
- Mark Vernon — hi-jacked judgement; condescending; he bullied us to use his platform
- NutriAsia
- wasteful on the tickets — we didn’t have to have tickets just to always get in the premises
- Waste segregation not implemented
- Water bottles are not allowed but they distributed them anyway — they could have had refilling stations instead
- cannot bring own food inside the premises — unfortunate for those with allergies and dietary restrictions
- fucked up WiFi
- puro lalaki ang judge
- nasaktan si rage; 
- WALA KAMING LIGO

## How to move forward?
- ayusin ang logistics — book hotel if possible and/or needed
- clarify yung mechanics — make sure we know exactly what we’re getting into: rules, facilities, FOOD, 
- consolidate contacts
- upload photos — post on facebook
